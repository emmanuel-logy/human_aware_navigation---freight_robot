  - [4. ROS Setup](#4-ros-setup)

## 1. Requirements
This repo was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS noetic so it requires prior installation of [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).

## 2. Repository Setup
In-order to setup the repository locally on your system, open a new terminal and follow the instructions below

    mkdir catkin_ws
    cd catkin_ws
    git clone https://github.com/dennyboby/human_aware_robot_navigation.git

## 3. Unity Setup
To setup Unity open Unity Hub and follow the instructions below:
1. Go to the `Installs` tab in Unity Hub, and click the `Add` button. Select Unity `2020.3.29f1`. If this version is no longer available through the hub, you can find it in the Unity Download Archive.
2. Go to the `Projects` tab in the Unity Hub, click the `Add` button, and navigate to and select the `Gopher-In-Unity-Simulation` directory within this cloned repository `(/PATH/TO/catkin_ws/human_aware_robot_navigation/Unity/Projects/Gopher-In-Unity-Simulation)` to add the project to your Hub.
3. Click the newly added project to open it.
4. After launching the project, please navigate to the `Scenes` folder and open the `Hospital` scene.

5. You can toggle the visibility of the ceiling in the game object hierarchy.

6. Next, the ROS TCP connection needs to be created. Select `Hospital -> TCPROSConnection` from the Hierarchy tab. Then in the Inspector tab in ROS Connection Script set `Ros IP Address` to be the IP address of your ROS machine (not the one running Unity). Find the IP address of your ROS machine. In Ubuntu, open a terminal window, and enter `hostname -I`.

7. Finally the simulation will look like the image shown below.

## 4. ROS Setup
To setup the ROS part of the repository open a new terminal and follow the instructions below.

    cd catkin_ws/human_aware_robot_navigation/ROS
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-catkin python3-catkin-tools
    catkin init
    catkin build
    source devel/setup.bash

Make sure that every new terminal running ROS components is sourced to avoid unable to find package issue.
In order to symlink python to the python3 version, open a new terminal and follow the instructions below ([link](https://packages.debian.org/sid/main/python-is-python3)).

    sudo apt install python-is-python3
